# CS-210-Project-Three
Corner Grocer C++ and Java Project
# Project Summary
The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. The program addresses the following requirements:

Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.
# Project Success
Creating the Python code that parses the text file.
Efficient use of functions and avoidance of redundant code.
Solid input validation and user redirection strategies.
# Improvement Opportunities
It would have been interesting to integrate with a database instead of a text file.  The timestamps from a database would help better identify trends and buying patterns.  This would also provide visibility6 to stock levels and the program could automatically alert employees to perform restocking or resupply activities.  It could also monitor slow moving items and initiate promotions to increase customer purchases.
# Project Challenges
A lot of work went into making input validation work within the program loops and menu switch. The process reinforced the importance of command structure and intense testing throughout the development.  The file parsing and concatination was also more challenging than expected and required additional libraries to get working properly.
# Skills Gained
Making C++ and Python work together in Visual Studio was problematic and forced me to really dig into the documentation and articles online.  Instead of simply making it work, I learned a great deal about the development environment and the requirements to make languages not included by default become properly integrated.  Additionally, I learned a great deal about using switch practically during this project and nested loops more intricately than I have previously.
# Best Practices
The code execution and options are well documented and the code size was significantly reduced through the use of nested loops and functions.  The functions could probably be better commented to help collaborators save time by not having to figure out how they work.  The program was developed modularly enough that it should be easy to maintain and expand in the future.
